# MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS FOR VRCHAT
_Mechanical conversions, and methods for VRChat_

This is a broader guide on how to, with demonstrations (visual, and files) for mechanical conversions / functions using vrchat built-in constraints and components within Unity.

> Underlying intermediate knowledge of, and how to use unity is assumed, basic functionalities and methods will __NOT__ be covered!

## ABOUT
Mechanical functionality has always been a goal for me, now after a prolongue break from VRC and other devlopment within game "world".  I now introduce myself;  

*Hello, I am OREO that is a simplification of my name OREOOROKANANEKO.  My experience within optronical-, electrooptical-, electronic-, mechanical- design and drafting spans now closer to 4 years as a professional. My hobby of VRChat has been re-ignited with the exit from working fulltime, having freedom to create drives me, so here we are.*

This project has a broad scope of making CAD and complex mechanisms more common within VRC, with less performance impact, and more wow^2 factor!  It is not for beginners to sadly, due to the complicated nature of having to put into words how to use Unity and VRChat functions / components / constraints, however instead focusing on intermediate to advanced development.

First few guides will be about the basic principles and design considerations, and of course sub-chapters thereof to go into depth.

I wish you good luck, whatever your endeavour may be!
