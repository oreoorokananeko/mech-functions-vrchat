# MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS FOR VRCHAT
_Mechanical conversions, and methods for VRChat_

This is a broader guide on how to, with demonstrations (visual, and files) for mechanical conversions / functions using vrchat built-in constraints and components within Unity. 

## CONTENSE
+ 1.x - Basic principles
+ 2.x - Design considerations, and limitations
+ 3.x - Rigging
+ 4.x - Interactions & function
+ 5.x - Animation considerations, and tips
+ 6.x - Other, non-specified

> [!WARNING]
> Underlying intermediate knowledge of, and how to use unity is assumed, basic functionalities and methods will __NOT__ be covered!

## ABOUT / FOREWORD
MECHANICAL-FUNCTIONS, or abreviated MECHFUN, is an effort to optimise, streamline, and distribute information about all things mechanical or complex I and others find useful.

Thus there are 3 main goals, to be;
+ Easily readable content, with clear examples.
+ Easily expanded-upon, and further developed
+ Easily translated, and distributed

>[!TIP]
>Using example scenes, and transfering existing systems over to your project can speed up and/or ease creation of complex projects.
